Create a system information script that gathers CPU, memory, disk, OS, and network information using psutil. The script should have a command-line interface with both pretty-print and JSON output options. Include an apply script that installs dependencies and runs the program.

Requirements:
1. Create a system_info package with __init__.py, info.py, and cli.py
2. The info.py should contain functions to gather system information using psutil
3. The cli.py should parse command-line arguments and provide both pretty-print and JSON output
4. Create a top-level run_system_info.py entry point script
5. Create an _apply.sh script that installs psutil and runs the program
6. Handle permission errors gracefully (like network connection access)
7. Provide comprehensive system information including CPU, memory, disk, OS, network, and process details
